<h2>1. Introduction</h2>
<p>This project was developed as the final exam of the course Open Access and Digital Ethics within the master course degree Digital Humanities and Digital Knowledge, of the University of Bologna, held by professor Monica Palmirani.</p>
<p>The aim of the project was to <b>develop effective visualizations</b> starting from an hypothesis of <b>re-use of datasets</b> free from cognitive biases, fair, legal valid, consistent, accurate.</p>
<p>To achieve this goal, our workflow began with the definition of the main idea, thus the selection of the <b>application scenario</b>; followed by <b>data collection and data analysis</b>; to the <b>mash-up of collected data</b> to compose a new dataset whose data would then be displayed through graphs, maps and other <b>appropriate visualizations</b>.</p>
<p>Source datasets have been collected from official and established European and international institutions and then analyzed from an ethical-legal and technical point of view. To manage a mash-up of different datasets with different licenses we have followed the Guidelines for Open Data provided by the EU, with particular regard to data curation. In these steps we had to analyze legal and ethics issues, economical and sustainable aspects, technical and metadata foundations; in order to produce accurate  metadata using DCAT_AP through RDF.</p>

<h2>2. Scenario</h2>
<h4>Is human trafficking related to the country well-being within an International Organisation?</h4>
<p>In order to choose our scenario, we decided to select the type of data to publish according to the G8 Open Data Charter and European Commission guidelines (Open Data Goldbook for Data Managers and Data Holders by the European Data Portal). Indeed, some categories of data are more relevant than others and have higher potential values: companies, crime and justice, earth observation, education, energy and environment, finance and contracts, geospatial, global development, government accountability and democracy, health, science and research, statistics, social mobility and welfare, transport and infrastructures. For this reason we chose a scenario at the crossroads of different categories: human trafficking and its supposedly related factors, such as the well-being of a country. The main category of reference data is crime and justice, but secondly some data belongs to the categories of education, development and government.</p>
<p>This project scenario could be explained more clearly through the 3 w:</p>
<p>1) <b>WHAT</b>: human trafficking and supposedly related factors. We tried to investigate data, through data analysis and visualization, to try to understand if there were any patterns, trends, in the evolution of this crime over the years and especially in the individual states. Given the delicacy but also the complexity of the topic, we immediately asked ourselves whether human trafficking was linked to the well-being of a state, defined on the basis of criteria of economic development, individual happiness, gross domestic product and so on. It is commonplace to think that the states with the highest poverty rate are the states with the highest crime rate, but is this really the case? If so, are there any states where this correlation is more evident? These are just some of the questions we asked ourselves.</p>
<p>2) <b>WHEN</b>: the 2000s, most data are between 2007 and 2016. We decided to choose this time range for two main reasons: firstly, the greater quantity and quality of data at our disposal regarding human trafficking as a crime, but also the greater quantity and quality of secondary or complementary data. Secondly, we chose a time range large enough to allow us to have an overview of the trend of this crime, but not too broad to prevent us from grasping significant patterns on a small scale.</p>
<p>3) <b>WHERE</b>: the states of the European Union. Most of the datasets we found contain data on all states of the world or most of them. We were more interested in investigating this phenomenon within an international organization such as the European Union. This is for several reasons: firstly, to try to understand if there are national differences (or, better, how many differences and how big) despite having adhered to the same declarations of struggle in favor of human rights, and adhering to the same economic policies. Secondly, because when we talk about human trafficking we first think of the poorest countries in the world, when various sources argue that it is a crime widely supported by the richest nations of the continents, including Europe.</p>
<p>4) <b>WHO</b> (the victims): age, sex, country of origin. Our focus was more on victims than on traffickers. We believe that individual characteristics of these people, such as their citizenship or their sex, linked to the forms of exploitation they have suffered, can give us more interesting insights into what are the reasons for trafficking in human beings, what are its networks and why certain places are more privileged than others.</p>
<p>5) <b>WHY</b>: forms of exploitation, as they could be considered as the scope of human traffickers. Trafficking in human beings is a crime linked to different forms of exploitation: forced labor, child labor, forced prostitution, illegal international adoptions and much more. Identifying the links between all these crimes can certainly help fight them more effectively.</p>


<h2>3. Overview on datasets</h2>
<p>Given the scenario chosen for this project, we decided to select two broad categories of datasets: one that specifically concerns the trafficking of human beings, so we looked for datasets that contained data on victims, forms and places of exploitation; and the other that could instead give us an image of the nations of the European Union from an economic, social, growth and well-being point of view. We have therefore selected datasets of established international institutions and organizations:</p>
<p><b>CTDC - Counter Trafficking Data Collaborative</b>: first global data hub on human trafficking, with data contributed by organizations from around the world (e.g.,IOM ‚Äì International Organization for Migration, Liberty Shared, Polaris Project). Launched in November 2017, the goal of CTDC is to break down information-sharing barriers and equip the counter-trafficking community with up to date, reliable data on human trafficking. It counts 108,613 individual cases collected, 164 countries of exploitation, 175 nationalities. Its web resource provides 376 resources, 24 datasets, 21 data story, 13 documents and 4 data dashboard.</p>
<p><b>UNODC ‚Äì Office on Drugs and Crime of the United Nations</b>: UNODC research and data provider constitutes the key global authority in the fields of drugs and crime, providing high-quality, essential evidence to inform policy-making and valuable sources of knowledge in drugs and crime domains. The Thematic Program on Research, Trend Analysis and Forensics defines the key challenges, work priorities and quality standards, as well as managing global and regional data collections, provides scientific and forensic services, defines research standards, and supports Member States to strengthen their data collection, research and forensics capacity.</p>
<p><b>EU Commission and EU Open Data Portal</b>: the European Union Commission, to address trafficking in human beings the EU, has put in place a comprehensive, gender-specific and victim-centred legal and policy framework and has developed a dedicated EU Anti-Trafficking resource called ‚ÄúTogether Against Trafficking in Human Beings‚Äù collecting Legal and Policy Framework, information about EU projects and funding, as well as publications and reports. Data on human trafficking are also available on the EU Open Data Portal and the European Data Portal.</p>
<p><b>World Bank Group and World Bank Open Data</b>: provides free and open access to global development data. At the World Bank, the Development Data Group coordinates statistical and data work and maintains a number of macro, financial and sector databases. Working closely with the Bank‚Äôs regions and Global Practices, the group is guided by professional standards in the collection, compilation and dissemination of data to ensure that all data users can have confidence in the quality and integrity of the data produced.</p>
<p><b>OECD ‚Äì Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development</b>: international organisation that works to build better policies for better lives, having the goal of shaping policies that foster prosperity, equality, opportunity and well-being for all. Together with governments, policy makers and citizens, OECD works on establishing evidence-based international standards and finding solutions to a range of social, economic and environmental challenges. From improving economic performance and creating jobs to fostering strong education and fighting international tax evasion, OECD provides a unique forum and knowledge hub for data and analysis, exchange of experiences, best-practice sharing, and advice on public policies and international standard-setting. Among all these activities, OECD also collects statistical data on those indicators considered to be the signs of the wellness of a country.</p>
